          range [0..12 GiB]. Can include units, e.g. "4KiB". A setting of 0 means the canister will have
          access to memory on a “best-effort” basis: It will only be charged for the memory it uses, but at
          any point in time may stop running if it tries to allocate more memory when there isn’t space
          available on the subnet

      --provisional-create-canister-effective-canister-id <PRINCIPAL>
          The effective canister id for provisional canister creation must be a canister id in the canister

dfx canister request-status --help
Requests the status of a call from a canister

Usage: dfx canister request-status [OPTIONS] <REQUEST_ID> <CANISTER>

Arguments:
  <REQUEST_ID>  Specifies the request identifier. The request identifier is an hexadecimal string starting
                with 0x
  <CANISTER>    Specifies the name or id of the canister onto which the request was made. If the request was
                made to the Management canister, specify the id of the canister it is updating/querying. If

      --ic
          Shorthand for --network=ic

          Updates the settings of all canisters configured in the project dfx.json files

      --network <NETWORK>
          Override the compute network to connect to. By default, the local network is used. A valid URL
          (starting with `http:` or `https:`) can be used here, and a special ephemeral network will be
          created specifically for this request. E.g. "http://localhost:12345/" is a valid network name

  -v, --verbose...
          Displays detailed information about operations. -vv will generate a very large number of messages
          and can affect performance

          of creating normal canisters

  -q, --quiet...
          Suppresses informational messages. -qq limits to errors only; -qqqq disables them all

      --set-controller <SET_CONTROLLER>
          Specifies the identity name or the principal of the new controller. Can be specified more than
          once, indicating the canister will have multiple controllers. If any controllers are set with this
          parameter, any other controllers will be removed

      --add-controller <ADD_CONTROLLER>
          Add a principal to the list of controllers of the canister

      --ic
          Shorthand for --network=ic

      --log <LOGMODE>
          The logging mode to use. You can log to stderr, a file, or both

          [default: stderr]
          [possible values: stderr, tee, file]

      --logfile <LOGFILE>
          The file to log to, if logging to a file (see --logmode)

      --remove-controller <REMOVE_CONTROLLER>
          Removes a principal from the list of controllers of the canister

      --wallet <WALLET>
          Specify a wallet canister id to perform the call. If none specified, defaults to use the selected
          Identity's wallet canister

  -c, --compute-allocation <COMPUTE_ALLOCATION>
          Specifies the canister's compute allocation. This should be a percent in the range [0..100]

      --identity <IDENTITY>
          The user identity to run this command as. It contains your principal as well as some things DFX
          associates with it like the wallet

          [env: DFX_IDENTITY=]

      --memory-allocation <MEMORY_ALLOCATION>
          Specifies how much memory the canister is allowed to use in total. This should be a value in the
          range [0..12 GiB]. Can include units, e.g. "4KiB". A setting of 0 means the canister will have
          access to memory on a “best-effort” basis: It will only be charged for the memory it uses, but at
          any point in time may stop running if it tries to allocate more memory when there isn’t space
          available on the subnet

      --provisional-create-canister-effective-canister-id <PRINCIPAL>
          The effective canister id for provisional canister creation must be a canister id in the canister
          ranges of the subnet on which new canisters should be created

      --freezing-threshold <FREEZING_THRESHOLD>
          Sets the freezing_threshold in SECONDS. A canister is considered frozen whenever the IC estimates
          that the canister would be depleted of cycles before freezing_threshold seconds pass, given the
          canister's current size and the IC's current cost for storage. A frozen canister rejects any calls
          made to it

      --reserved-cycles-limit <RESERVED_CYCLES_LIMIT>
          Sets the upper limit of the canister's reserved cycles balance.

          Reserved cycles are cycles that the system sets aside for future use by the canister. If a
          subnet's storage exceeds 450 GiB, then every time a canister allocates new storage bytes, the
          system sets aside some amount of cycles from the main balance of the canister. These reserved
          cycles will be used to cover future payments for the newly allocated bytes. The reserved cycles
          are not transferable and the amount of reserved cycles depends on how full the subnet is.

          A setting of 0 means that the canister will trap if it tries to allocate new storage while the
          subnet's memory usage exceeds 450 GiB.

      --wasm-memory-limit <WASM_MEMORY_LIMIT>
          Sets a soft limit on the Wasm memory usage of the canister.

          Update calls, timers, heartbeats, installs, and post-upgrades fail if the Wasm memory usage
          exceeds this limit. The main purpose of this setting is to protect against the case when the
          canister reaches the hard 4GiB limit.

          Must be a number between 0 B and 256 TiB, inclusive. Can include units, e.g. "4KiB".

      --log-visibility <LOG_VISIBILITY>
          Specifies who is allowed to read the canister's logs. Can be either "controllers" or "public"

      --confirm-very-long-freezing-threshold
          Freezing thresholds above ~1.5 years require this flag as confirmation

  -y, --yes
          Skips yes/no checks by answering 'yes'. Such checks can result in loss of control, so this is not
          recommended outside of CI

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

dfx canister url --help
Prints the url of a canister

Usage: dfx canister url [OPTIONS] <CANISTER>

Arguments:
  <CANISTER>  Specifies the name or id of the canister

Options:
      --network <NETWORK>
          Override the compute network to connect to. By default, the local network is used. A valid URL
          (starting with `http:` or `https:`) can be used here, and a special ephemeral network will be
          created specifically for this request. E.g. "http://localhost:12345/" is a valid network name
  -v, --verbose...
          Displays detailed information about operations. -vv will generate a very large number of messages
          and can affect performance
      --playground
          Shorthand for --network=playground. Borrows short-lived canisters on the real IC network instead
          of creating normal canisters
  -q, --quiet...
          Suppresses informational messages. -qq limits to errors only; -qqqq disables them all
      --ic
          Shorthand for --network=ic
      --log <LOGMODE>
          The logging mode to use. You can log to stderr, a file, or both [default: stderr] [possible

      --logfile <LOGFILE>
          The file to log to, if logging to a file (see --logmode)
      --wallet <WALLET>
