# Installing DFX Dashboard

This guide will walk you through installing DFX Dashboard and its prerequisite, `dfx`.

## Installing `dfx` via `dfxvm`

Before installing DFX Dashboard, you need to install `dfx`, which is part of the Internet Computer SDK.

:::info
`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.* Monterey or later. For Windows users, you can run `dfx` using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), although not all features may be supported.
:::

To install `dfx`, we'll use `dfxvm`, a tool for managing different versions of `dfx`.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to download and install the latest version of `dfxvm`:

```sh
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
```

:::tip
If you're using a machine with Apple silicon, you'll need to have Rosetta installed. You can install Rosetta by running `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.
:::

3. After installation, you can verify the installation by running:

```sh
dfx --version
```

## Using Bundled `dfx` in DFX Dashboard

While it's recommended to install `dfx` separately as described above, DFX Dashboard also provides a bundled version of `dfx`.

:::tip
If you prefer not to install `dfx` separately or need to use a specific version, you can use the bundled `dfx` version in DFX Dashboard.
:::

To use the bundled version:

1. **Open** DFX Dashboard.
2. **Navigate** to the **Settings page**.
3. Look for the option to **toggle between** system `dfx` and bundled `dfx`.
4. **Select** "Use Bundled DFX".

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, follow these steps to verify that DFX Dashboard is correctly installed:

1. Open **DFX Dashboard** from your applications menu.
2. **Navigate** to the **"About"** section in the sidebar.
3. **Check the version number** displayed to ensure it matches the version you downloaded.
