## 1. Setting Up Your Environment

### Configuring Settings and Shell Completion

1. Navigate to the [Settings](/features/settings) page.
2. Choose between bundled DFX (v0.25.0) and system DFX.
3. **Set up shell completion** for enhanced command-line productivity:
   - The dashboard automatically detects your shell (bash, zsh, fish)
   - Use one-click setup for supported shells
   - Copy manual setup commands for unsupported shells
4. Configure important environment variables like `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH` and `DFX_VERSION`.

:::tip
Enable shell completion to get tab completion for dfx commands, options, and canister names in your terminal.
:::

:::warning
Ensure you understand the implications of changing environment variables, as they can affect your project's functionality.
:::

## 2. Managing Projects

1. Go to the [Projects](/features/projects) page.
2. Click **Create New Project** to start a new Internet Computer project.
3. Fill in the project details:
   - Project name
   - Project path
   - Frontend type (e.g., React, Vue)
   - Canister type (e.g., Motoko, Rust)
4. Use the **Open With** button to launch your project in your preferred code editor.

:::tip
Use descriptive names for your projects to easily identify them in the dashboard and leverage the enhanced filtering capabilities.
:::

## 3. Working with Canisters (Enhanced with NNS Support)

1. Navigate to the [Canisters](/features/canisters) page to view all canisters across your projects.
2. **Use advanced filtering** to manage large numbers of canisters:
   - Filter by type: All, User, or NNS canisters
   - Filter by network: Local, IC, or custom networks
   - Search by name, ID, or project
3. **Explore NNS canisters** for network-level operations:
   - View governance, ledger, and other system canisters
   - Use specialized NNS query interfaces
   - Access read-only operations for safety
4. Use the **Canister Actions** button to:
   - View comprehensive metadata
   - Check canister status
   - Top up with cycles
   - Access method calling interfaces
5. Utilize the command interface for advanced canister operations with dfx 0.25.0 compatibility.

:::tip
Use the filtering options to quickly find specific canisters in large deployments, and explore NNS canisters to understand network-level operations.
:::

:::warning
Be cautious when performing actions like stopping or deleting canisters, as these can affect your application's functionality. NNS canisters are read-only for safety.
:::

## 4. Managing Identities

1. Visit the [Identities](/features/identities) page.
2. Click **Create New Identity** to add a new identity.
3. Choose between creating a new identity, importing an existing one, or using Internet Identity.
4. Use the **Select** button to set an active identity for your operations.

:::tip
Use different identities for development and production environments to enhance security, especially when working with both user and NNS canisters.
:::

## 5. Professional Cycle Management

1. On the [Cycles](/features/cycles) page, explore the new tabbed interface:

### Balance & Approvals Tab
- **Check cycle balances** for any principal or subaccount
- **Set up cycle approvals** for automated systems
- **Specify networks** and use precise balance options

### Transfers & Top-ups Tab
- **Transfer cycles** between accounts with subaccount support
- **Top up canisters** with precise amounts
- **Use memos** for transaction tracking

### Convert & Faucet Tab
- **Convert ICP to cycles** with subaccount support
- **Redeem faucet coupons** for development cycles
- **Monitor conversion rates** before proceeding

:::tip
Use subaccounts to organize cycles for different projects or purposes, and leverage cycle approvals for automated systems.
:::

:::warning
Always double-check recipient addresses and amounts when transferring cycles, as these transactions cannot be reversed.
:::

## 6. Configuring Networks

1. Access the [Network](/features/network) page to view and edit your `networks.json` configuration.
2. Modify the JSON directly in the editor to add or change network settings.
3. Define custom networks for different development stages or environments.

:::tip
Use descriptive names for custom networks to easily identify their purpose within the Dashboard and leverage network filtering in the canisters page.
:::

## 7. Reviewing Logs

1. Check the [Logs](/features/logs) page for a history of commands executed in the Dashboard.
2. Use the action buttons to:
   - View command outputs
   - Re-execute commands
   - Copy command text

:::tip
Utilize the search and filter options to quickly find specific commands in your history, especially useful with the new dfx 0.25.0 command syntax.
:::

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

:::warning
Watch out for these common pitfalls:

- **dfx version compatibility**: Ensure you're using dfx 0.25.0+ for full feature support
- **Shell completion not working**: Open a new terminal session after setup
- **NNS canister errors**: Ensure you're using query operations only for NNS canisters
- **Filtering issues**: Try clearing search terms and resetting filters if results seem incorrect
- If commands fail, check your active identity and ensure it has the necessary permissions
- For network-related issues, verify your internet connection and firewall settings
- If canisters aren't deploying, check your cycle balance and network configuration
- **Subaccount format errors**: Ensure subaccounts are properly formatted (32-byte hex)
- For unexpected behavior, try refreshing the Dashboard or restarting the application
- Always keep your DFX and DFXVM versions up to date to avoid compatibility issues
