# Logs

The Logs page provides a comprehensive view of your DFX Dashboard command history, allowing you to **review**, **re-execute**, and **analyze** past commands run within the DFX Dashboard.

## Overview

<div class="image-border">

![Logs Overview](/features/logs/logs-overview.png)

</div>

The Logs page displays:
- A table of executed dfx commands
- Options to **view command outputs**, **re-execute commands**, and **copy command** text
- **Filtering** and **search capabilities**

:::info
Only commands run through the DFX Dashboard are recorded here, not those executed in your terminal.
:::

## Command History Table

The command history table includes the following columns:
1. **Date**: The date when the command was executed.
2. **Time**: The specific time of command execution.
3. **Type**: The category of the command (e.g., CANISTER).
4. **Command**: The actual dfx command that was run.
5. **Action**: Buttons to interact with the command (**view output, re-execute, copy**).

:::tip
Use the Date and Time columns to track your project's development timeline and identify when specific actions were taken.
:::

## Interacting with Commands

For each command in the history, you have three action options:

1. **View Command Output** (â“˜ icon):
   - Click to open a modal showing the command's output.
   - The modal displays the command, its execution path, and the resulting output.

</div>

2. **Re-execute Command** (â–¶ icon):
   - Click to run the command again within the DFX Dashboard.
   - Useful for repeating actions or comparing results.

3. **Copy Command** (ðŸ“‹ icon):
   - Click to copy the command text to your clipboard.
   - A confirmation message "Copied to Clipboard" will appear briefly.

:::warning
Be cautious when re-executing commands, especially those that modify canister state or deploy code. Ensure you understand the implications of running the command again.
:::

## Filtering and Searching

The Logs page offers several ways to locate particular commands:

1. **Search Bar**:
   - Use the "Search Between Commands" field to find specific command text.
2. **Date and Time Sorting**:
   - Click on the Date or Time column headers to sort commands chronologically.
3. **Type Filter**:
   - Use the dropdown (defaulted to "All") to filter commands by their type.
4. **Pagination**:
   - Navigate through multiple pages of command history using the pagination controls at the bottom.
5. **Rows per Page**:
   - Adjust the number of commands displayed per page using the dropdown at the bottom left.

:::tip
Combine search and filtering options to quickly locate specific commands, especially when troubleshooting issues or reviewing project history.

## Best Practices

:::tip
Optimize your use of the Logs feature:

- Use the re-execute feature to quickly repeat common tasks.
- Utilize the copy feature when you need to run a command with modifications in your terminal.
- Use the search and filter options to quickly find specific commands in a large history.
- Regularly review your command history to understand your project's development progress and identify areas for workflow optimization.
- Use the command history to document your development process or create tutorials for team members.
:::

## Troubleshooting

:::warning
Watch out for these common issues:

- If a command's output is unexpected, try re-executing it to see if the issue persists.
- If you can't find a command you remember running, ensure it was executed through the DFX Dashboard and not directly in your terminal.
- If re-executed commands consistently fail, check your project's current state and environment variables.
- For commands with long outputs, use the scroll function within the output modal to view all information.
- If the Logs page is loading slowly, consider clearing old logs or increasing the number of rows per page to reduce pagination.
