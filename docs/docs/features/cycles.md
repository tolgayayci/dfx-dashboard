# Cycles
*Manage and utilize cycles, the fuel for computation on the Internet Computer.*

The Cycles page is a crucial component of the DFX Dashboard, allowing you to view your cycle balance, convert ICP to cycles, transfer cycles, and top up canisters.

## Overview
*Your central hub for cycle management.*

The Cycles page displays your current cycle balance and provides three main functions:
- **Converting** ICP to cycles
- **Transferring** cycles to other principals
- **Topping up canisters** with cycles

---

## Cycles Balance
*Keep track of your available computational power.*

At the top of the Cycles page, you'll see your current cycles balance:

- The balance is displayed in TC (trillion cycles).
- Use the **Refresh** button to update your balance.

**Note**: Cycles are the fuel for computation on the Internet Computer. Every action on the network consumes cycles.

## Converting ICP to Cycles
*Transform your ICP tokens into usable cycles.*

To convert ICP to cycles:

1. Click on the **Convert ICP** tab.
2. Enter the amount of ICP you want to convert in the **Amount (ICP)** field.
3. Click the **Convert to Cycles** button to process the conversion.

**Note**: The conversion rate between ICP and cycles may vary. Always check the current rate before converting.

## Transferring Cycles
*Send cycles to other principals on the network.*

To transfer cycles:

1. Click on the **Transfer Cycles** tab.
2. Enter the recipient's principal in the **To (Principal)** field.
3. Specify the amount of cycles to transfer in the **Amount (Cycles)** field.
4. Click the **Transfer Cycles** button to send the cycles.

**Important**: Double-check the recipient's principal before transferring, as cycle transfers cannot be reversed.

## Topping Up Canisters
*Fuel your canisters with cycles for continued operation.*

To top up a canister:

1. Click on the **Top Up Canister** tab.
2. Choose how to select the canister:
   - **Select from list**: Choose a canister from your projects
   - **Enter custom ID**: Input a specific canister ID
3. Enter the amount of cycles to send in the **Amount (Cycles)** field.
4. Click the **Top Up Canister** button to complete the process.

**Tip**: Regularly check and top up your canisters to ensure they have sufficient cycles to continue running.

## Best Practices
*Optimize your cycle management with these tips.*

- **Monitor your balance**: Regularly check your cycle balance to ensure you have enough for your operations.
- **Plan conversions**: Convert ICP to cycles in advance to avoid running out during critical operations.
- **Estimate needs**: Before topping up canisters, estimate their cycle consumption to avoid over or under-funding.
- **Keep records**: Track your cycle transfers and conversions for better financial management.

---

## Troubleshooting
*Quick solutions for common cycle-related issues.*

- If your **balance isn't updating**, try refreshing the page or restarting the DFX Dashboard.
- **For failed conversions**, ensure you have sufficient ICP balance and that the network is operational.
- **If a transfer fails**, double-check the recipient's principal and your available cycle balance.
- For **canister top-up issues**, verify that the canister ID is correct and that you have sufficient cycles.
