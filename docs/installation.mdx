This guide will walk you through installing DFX Dashboard and its prerequisite, `dfx`.

## Installing `dfx` via `dfxvm`

Before installing DFX Dashboard, you need to install `dfx`, which is part of the Internet Computer SDK.

<Info>
`dfx` is natively supported on Linux or macOS 12.* Monterey or later. For Windows users, you can run `dfx` using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2), although not all features may be supported.
</Info>

To install `dfx`, we'll use `dfxvm`, a tool for managing different versions of `dfx`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your terminal">
    Launch your terminal application on macOS or Linux.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dfxvm">
    Run the following command to download and install the latest version of `dfxvm`:
    
    ```bash
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    After installation, you can verify the installation by running:
    
    ```bash
    dfx --version
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If you're using a machine with Apple silicon, you'll need to have Rosetta installed. You can install Rosetta by running `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` in your terminal.
</Tip>

## Using Bundled `dfx`
