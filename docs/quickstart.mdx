## Getting Started Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Your Environment">
    Start by setting up your development environment and shell completion.
    
    ### Settings, Shell Completion, and Cache Management
    
    1. Navigate to the [Settings & Cache](/features/settings) page
    2. **General Tab**: Choose between bundled DFX (v0.25.0) and system DFX
    3. **Shell Completion Tab**: Set up shell completion for enhanced command-line productivity:
       - The dashboard automatically detects your shell (bash, zsh, fish)
       - Use one-click setup for supported shells
       - Copy manual setup commands for unsupported shells
    4. **Cache Tab**: Manage your DFX version installations:
       - View all installed DFX versions
       - Install new versions or remove unused ones
       - Monitor cache size and clear when needed
    5. Configure important environment variables like `CANISTER_CANDID_PATH` and `DFX_VERSION`
    
    <Tip>
    Enable shell completion to get tab completion for dfx commands, options, and canister names in your terminal.
    </Tip>
    
    <Warning>
    Ensure you understand the implications of changing environment variables, as they can affect your project's functionality.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create or Import a Project">
    Set up your first Internet Computer project.
    
    ### Managing Projects
    
    1. Go to the [Projects](/features/projects) page
    2. Click **Create New Project** to start a new Internet Computer project
    3. Fill in the project details:
       - Project name
       - Project path
       - Frontend type (e.g., React, Vue)
       - Canister type (e.g., Motoko, Rust)
    4. Use the **Open With** button to launch your project in your preferred code editor
    
    <Tip>
    Use descriptive names for your projects to easily identify them in the dashboard and leverage the enhanced filtering capabilities.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage Identities and ICP">
    Set up your digital identities and handle ICP operations.
    
    ### Identities and Ledger Operations
    
    1. Visit the [Identities & Ledger](/features/identities) page
    2. **Identities Tab**: Manage your digital identities:
       - Click **Create New Identity** to add a new identity
       - Choose between creating a new identity, importing an existing one, or using Internet Identity
       - Use the **Select** button to set an active identity for your operations
    3. **Ledger Tab**: Handle ICP operations with three sub-tabs:
       - **Account Management**: View balances and convert principals to account IDs
       - **ICP Operations**: Transfer ICP, create canisters, top-up operations, and fabricate cycles
       - **Transaction History**: Monitor and track all your ICP transactions
    
    <Tip>
    Use different identities for development and production environments to enhance security. The integrated ledger functionality allows you to manage ICP directly from the identity page.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy and Manage Canisters">
    Work with both user and NNS canisters using advanced filtering.
    
    ### Working with Canisters (Enhanced with NNS Support)
    
    1. Navigate to the [Canisters](/features/canisters) page to view all canisters across your projects
    2. **Use advanced filtering** to manage large numbers of canisters:
       - Filter by type: All, User, or NNS canisters
       - Filter by network: Local, IC, or custom networks
       - Search by name, ID, or project
    3. **Explore NNS canisters** for network-level operations:
       - View governance, ledger, and other system canisters
       - Use specialized NNS query interfaces
       - Access read-only operations for safety
    4. Use the **Canister Actions** button to:
       - View comprehensive metadata
       - Check canister status
       - Top up with cycles
       - Access method calling interfaces
    5. Utilize the command interface for advanced canister operations with dfx 0.25.0 compatibility
    
    <Tip>
    Use the filtering options to quickly find specific canisters in large deployments, and explore NNS canisters to understand network-level operations.
    </Tip>
    
    <Warning>
    Be cautious when performing actions like stopping or deleting canisters, as these can affect your application's functionality. NNS canisters are read-only for safety.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>
